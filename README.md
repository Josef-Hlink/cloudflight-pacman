# cloudflight-pacman

Cloudflight coding contest 11-11-22 in Amsterdam

Some very basic pacman exercises

Did this together with DaniÃ«l & Lizanne

## requirements

- `Python 3`
- `numpy`

## level description

### 2

You get a board with a pacman, and you get a string of moves that pacman will do.
You simply check how many coins pacman will collect.

### 3

Same thing as in 2, but now there's also some moving ghosts.
You have to return the number of coins that pacman has collected, and whether or not he survived.

### 4

This one is a lot harder.
You get a board with a pacman and some static ghosts.
You have to find a string of moves that makes pacman collect all coins without dying.
This string has to be less than a given "max moves" number specified in the input file.
